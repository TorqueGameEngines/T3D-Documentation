                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXBuffer</span></h2>
                <p>Objects of this class hold sound data on the sound device. Buffers
                  will be deleted when no longer used but will also be freed when the
                  device is destroyed. Use StrongWeakRefPtrs to permanently refer to
                  SFXBuffers so that references will null out when the buffer goes away. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Loading and updating of sound buffers happens on dedicated
                  SFX update threads created by the individual devices. For devices that
                  do not create such a thread, updating will happen on the main thread;
                  this, however, is currently only used by the Null device. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Buffers hold raw, uncompressed PCM sample data loaded from SFXStreams. SFXBuffers for normal, buffered playback will be loaded once in entirety and may then be used by an arbitrary number of SFXVoices for concurrent playback. </p>
                <p><br />
                  SFXBuffers for streamed playback will be loaded progressively in the background and are tied to a single unique SFXVoice. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Important:</b> Do not use delete directly on an SFXBuffer.  Instead call <b>destroySelf()</b> on the buffer to delete it. Buffers may have pending asynchronous
                  operations that need to flush out first before the buffer can actually
                  be deleted. </p><br />
                <a name="SFXVoice" id="SFXVoice"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXVoice</span></h2>
                <p>This is an abstract base class for objects on the sound device that
                  the control playback of a particular SFXBuffer. Usually, a device will
                  limit the number of concurrent sound playbacks it supports. SFXVoices
                  follow the same lifecycle as SFXBuffers. An SFXVoice should never be
                  directly deleted by clients. Leave lifetime management to
                  reference-counting. </p>
                <p><br />
                  An SFXVoice promoted to playing state when its attached
                  SFXBuffer has not yet fully loaded will temporarily transition into
                  SFXStatusBlocked to indicate that playback can't progress. This will
                  also happen for streamed sounds when the playback cursor is outrunning
                  the stream feed. </p><br />
                <a name="SFXStream" id="SFXStream"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXStream</span></h2>
                <p>Abstract base class for reading raw PCM sample streams. Instances of
                  subclasses will be used for all sound loading that goes through SFX's
                  own loading system (in contrast to sound loading happening directly
                  through the sound API in use). Both buffered and streamed sounds are
                  loaded through SFXStreams. </p>
                <p><br />
                  SFXStreams are used concurrently from multiple threads and
                  are concurrently reference-counted to ensure proper and safe
                  reclamation. For an SFXStream to support seeking in combination with
                  streamed playback, it must implement cloning through the clone()
                  method. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Streamed playback that also loops will require the attached SFXStream to properly reset(). </p>
                <a name="SFXFileStream" id="SFXFileStream"></a><br />
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXFileStream</span></h2>
                <p>This is the abstract base class for specific file format loaders. </p><br />
                <a name="SFXResource" id="SFXResource"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXResource</span></h2>
                <p>Thin wrapper that represents as sound file on disk. Performs a
                  header read on the file to detect SFXFormat characteristics. Does not
                  keep actual sound data. </p><br />
                <a name="SFXDevice" id="SFXDevice"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXDevice</span></h2>
                <p>Abstract base class for SFX implementations against particular sound
                  APIs. Manages SFXVoices and SFXBuffers as the primary sound device
                  resources. The lifetimes of all sound resources are bound to their
                  respective SFXDevice. Only one SFXDevice will ever be instanced at any
                  one point. </p><br />
                <a name="SFXProvider" id="SFXProvider"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXProvider</span></h2>
                <p>Abstract base class for objects that manage device creation on
                  particular sound APIs. There is one SFXProvider per supported sound
                  API. SFXProviders have no responsibilities besides enumerating,
                  querying, and creating SFXDevices. </p><br />
                <a name="SFXSystem" id="SFXSystem"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">SFXSystem</span></h2>
                <p>Singleton class that defines the central hub for the sound system.
                  Exposes the high-level interface of the system. Manages SFXSources and
                  the current SFXDevice instance. Exposes global SFX parameters. </p>
                <p><br />
                  SFXSystem::_update() is called from the main game loop to
                  periodically update the SFXSources in the system. Play-once source that
                  have stopped playing will purged in the process. Sound loading,
                  however, is usually handled on a dedicated thread rather than on the
                  main thread. </p><br />

                <p>You typically will not be working directly with the SFX internals,
                  unless you are heavily extending the SFX system. This guide was meant
                  to show you the major internal classes that drive the SFX system.
