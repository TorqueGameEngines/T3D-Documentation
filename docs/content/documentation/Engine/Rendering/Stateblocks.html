                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Concept</span></h2>
                <p>The purpose of GFXStateblocks is quite simple: an entire rendering
                  state is contained in one object, and you are able to set the rendering
                  state with one call. If you've written rendering code before, you may
                  have written code similar to this before: </p>
                <pre>// Enable Blending
glEnable (GL_BLEND);

// Set The Blend Mode		
glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_ALPHA ,GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  What if you need to setup that kind of rendering state more than
                  just once? GFXStateblocks allow you to wrap that up into the following: </p>
                <pre>GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(myState);
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  There's a little more tech and setup involved, but the above
                  example should be enough to encourage you to read on and use this
                  concept in your own project. </p><br>
                <a name="Technical_Description" id="Technical_Description"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Technical Description</span></h2>
                <p>Using GFXStateblocks allows you to pre-generate your rendering
                  states, which is going to save you time, cleanup your code, apply
                  modern rendering techniques, and give you more control over your game's
                  rendering from the engine <b>as well as script</b>. When combined with CustomMaterials, the material definitions in script need less custom engine support. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Stateblocks are created by filling out a GFXStateBlockDesc structure
                  and calling GFX-&gt;createStateBlock on it. This returns a
                  GFXStateBlockRef, which is a reference-counted GFXStateBlock. This is
                  essentially a GFXResource, just like a texture. Then you use a
                  stateblock by calling GFX-&gt;setStateBlock and passing the state block
                  in. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Using a stateblock fully defines a render state, which
                  completely does away with all concepts canonical. This is actually a
                  good thing as this will reduce bugs introduced because a state was not
                  properly cleaned up before exiting. </p><br>
                <a name="Source_Code" id="Source_Code"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Source Code</span></h2>
                <p>It might help if we tour the engine code, so you can get some concrete code samples in front of your eyes. Start by opening <b>gfxStateBlock.h</b> and <b>gfxStateBlock.cpp</b>, both of which are found in <i>engine/source/GFX</i>. Let's browse the header (.h) first. All four major declarations are important here: </p>
                <pre>struct GFXSamplerStateDesc {...};

struct GFXStateBlockDesc {...};

class GFXStateBlock {...};

typedef StrongRefPtr&lt;GFXStateBlock&gt; GFXStateBlockRef;
</pre><br>
                <a name="GFXSamplerStateDesc" id="GFXSamplerStateDesc"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">GFXSamplerStateDesc</span></h2>
                <p>The <b>GFXSamplerStateDesc</b> struct contains variables and methods
                  to identify the texture object used for each texture lookup. You'll
                  find texture arguments for color, alpha, min/mag/mip filter, and
                  address modes. A solid example of how this structure is used can be
                  found in the GFXGLStateBlock::activate(...) function. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Inside this method, a GFXSamplerStateDesc variable (ssd) is
                  set to one of the stateblocks internal samplers. The function performs
                  a check to see how OpenGL handles the GL_TEXTURE_2D variable: </p>
                <p><br />
                  Abbreviated code from GFXGLStateBlock::activate(...), found in engine/source/gfx/gl/gfxGLStateBlock.cpp </p>
                <pre>const GFXSamplerStateDesc ssd = mDesc.samplers[i];

switch (ssd.textureColorOp)
{
case GFXTOPDisable:
   if(!tex)
      break;
   glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
   updateTexParam = false;
   break;
}
</pre><br>
                <a name="GFXStateBlockDesc" id="GFXStateBlockDesc"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">GFXStateBlockDesc</span></h2>
                <p><b>GFXStateBlockDesc</b> defines a render state, which is then used
                  to create a GFXStateBlock instance. If you look through the structure,
                  you will read through some common render state ops and references:
                  blending (source/destination/operation), depth buffer (z buffer
                  enable/bias/definition), color writes (write red/blue/green/alpha), and
                  so on. </p>
                <p><br />
                  A nifty concept applied through GFXStateBlockDescr is the
                  combining state block descriptions. This is done so through
                  the::addDesc(...) function: </p>
<pre>
/// Adds data from desc to this description, uses *defined
parameters in desc to figure out what blocks of 
state to actually copy from desc.
void addDesc(const GFXStateBlockDesc&amp; desc);
</pre><br>
                <a name="GFXStateBlock" id="GFXStateBlock"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">GFXStateBlock</span></h2>
                <p>The base GFXStateBlock class looks very bare. It is derived from
                  StrongRefBase and GFXResource. Being a StrongRefBase object, the
                  stateblock will exist as long as the reference exists. When all of the
                  strong references to the stateblock go away, it is permanently deleted.
                  It is treated as a GFXResource since our GFX system needs to track its
                  resources owned by a particular device. </p>
                <p><br />
                  There are only 4 functions in this base class, and they are
                  all virtual. This is due to the fact that we have multiple graphical
                  APIs to support, which means we are going to have GFXStateBlocks for
                  DirectX and OpenGL: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>GFXD3D9StateBlock </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>GFXGLStateBlock </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br />
                  Of course, we have our null device stateblock
                  (GFXNullStateBlock), but you will not actually need to use that for any
                  rendering. The other GFX devices will have their own implementation of
                  stateblocks. In fact, let's take a look at the GL implementation. Open <i>engine/source/gfx/gl/gfxGLStateBlock.h</i>. The class we are looking at is <b>GFXGLStateBlock</b>. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Within this function we have a working interface (constructor and
                  destructor), a function called by OpenGL to activate the stateblock
                  (::activate), and a tangible GFXStateBlockDesc member variable (mDesc).
                  The activate function definition can be found in <b>gfxGLStateBlock.cpp</b> </p>
                <pre>GFXGLStateBlock::activate(const GFXGLStateBlock* oldState)
{
   // Internal code not shown
}
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  It is heavily commented and has a very important warning at the
                  beginning. It is highly recommended you read through the comments and
                  code to get a better understanding of how the stateblock is set up. </p><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">GFXStateBlockData</span></h2>
                <p>Two very important classes we need to take a look at is the GFXStateBlockData class<span

                    class</span>, found in <i>engine/source/gfx/sim/gfxStateBlockData.h/.cpp</i>.  The class definitions and their comments are quite descriptive: </p>
                <pre>/// Allows definition of render state via script, 
basically wraps a GFXStateBlockDesc
class GFXStateBlockData: public SimObject

/// Allows definition of sampler state via script, 
basically wraps a GFXSamplerStateDesc
class GFXSamplerStateData: public SimObject
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  As you read, these classes allow us to create GFXStateBlock and
                  GFXSamplerState descriptions in TorqueScript. This means you are able
                  to utilize a lot more custom shader and rendering work without being as
                  reliant on custom engine code. You should definitely look through
                  the::initPersistFields() functions for each class. You will
                  notice the various references and ops that make up a render state are
                  exposed. </p><br>
                <a name="Engine_Example" id="Engine_Example"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Engine Example</span></h2>
                <p>We are going to use a very simple engine example for showing how GFXStateBlocks are created and used. Start by opening <i>engine/source/interior/interior.h/.cpp</i>.
                  When we use debug rendering, we are able to see certain aspects of an
                  interior that are normally invisible to a player. One such aspect would
                  be the rendering of portals. </p>
                <p><br />
                  In the Interior class, we have defined multiple stateblock references. Let's look at one that affects our portal rendering: </p>
                <pre>GFXStateBlockRef mInteriorDebugPortalSB;
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  Ok! We have our stateblock reference, but it still needs some
                  information. Go into Interior.cpp, and scroll down to the
                  prepForRendering function around line 343: </p>
                <pre>bool Interior::prepForRendering(const char* path)
{
     // Previous and remaining code not shown

     mInteriorDebugPortalSB = GFX-&gt;createStateBlock(sh);

}
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  This line of code shows we have initialized our stateblock
                  reference, but what device does so? We haven't seen any OpenGL or
                  DirectX code anywhere, so how can we know if we are using a
                  GFXGLStateBlock or not? This is where GFX takes control. <b>GFX-&gt;createStateBlock(...)</b> takes in a fully initialized GFXStateBlockDesc reference. </p>
                <p><br />
                  GFX then proceeds to set up the hash value and search for existing
                  stateblocks. If the stateblock we need does not exist, it calls <b>createStateBlockInternal</b>.
                  This function drills into our platform's device, so we have a
                  GFXGLDevice::createStateBlockInternal and a
                  GFXD3D9Device::createStateBlockInternal. </p>
                <p><br />
                  When creating a GFXStateBlock in script, quite a few things
                  happen for you automatically. However, when you are in the engine there
                  are a few "Gotchas" you have to remember. <b>When you create a GFXStateBlock in the engine, you must call setStateBlock before you use it!</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Called in Interior::debugRenderPortals():</b> </p>
                <pre>GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(mInteriorDebugPortalSB);
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  A simple, more generic engine example would be this: </p>
                <pre>  // Setup code, done once
  GFXStateBlockDesc desc;
  desc.setBlend(true, GFXSrcAlpha, GFXInvSrcAlpha);
  GFXStateBlockRef myState = GFX-&gt;createStateBlock(desc);

  // Render time code
  GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(myState);

</pre><br>
                <a name="Script_Example" id="Script_Example"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Script Example</span></h2>
                <p>Earlier, I mentioned using shader data and GFXStateBlocks together
                  in script. We have provided you with a couple of examples. Open
                  Examples/FPS Example/game/core/scripts/client/postFX.cs. This file
                  contains multiple GFXStateBlockData and ShaderData definitions. First,
                  we focus on the default stateblock: </p>
                <pre>singleton GFXStateBlockData( PFX_DefaultStateBlock )
{
   zDefined = true;
   zEnable = false;
   zWriteEnable = false;
      
   samplersDefined = true;
   samplerStates[0] = SamplerClampLinear;
};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  The above code demonstrates how to declare a GFXStateBlock in TorqueScript using the exposed Console Object, <b>GFXStateBlockData</b>.
                  In this example, we define depth sorting and handle linear clamping. We
                  can then use this stateblock in a PostEffect definition: </p>
                <pre>singleton PostEffect( BL_ShadowFilterPostFx )
{
   requirements = "";

   shader = BL_ShadowFilterShader;
   stateBlock = PFX_DefaultStateBlock;
   targetClear = "PFXTargetClear_OnDraw";
   targetClearColor = "0 0 0 0";
   texture[0] = "$inTex";
   target = "$outTex";   
};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  A GFXStateBlockData definition can also be used in the creation of a separate stateblock, as shown below: </p>
                <pre>singleton GFXStateBlockData( LightRayStateBlock: PFX_DefaultStateBlock )
{
   samplersDefined = true;
   samplerStates[0] = SamplerClampLinear;
   samplerStates[1] = SamplerClampLinear;     
};
</pre>
                <p>Essentially, we wanted the exact same rendering state for our two
                  post processing effects. Instead of having to modify our engine code
                  (twice), we can define our stateblock in script (once) and use it
                  multiple times. </p><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
                <p>There is a lot to learn about GFXStateBlocks. The intent of this article
                  was to give you a strong introduction on the purpose, engine structure,
                  and examples of how to use this new system. As you develop new shaders,
