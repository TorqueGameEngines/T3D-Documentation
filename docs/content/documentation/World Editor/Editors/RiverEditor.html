                <p>The Torque 3D World Editor has a complete system for creating rivers and other small bodies of water. The River Editor is built-in WYSIWYG (<strong>W</strong>hat-<strong>Y</strong>ou-<strong>S</strong>ee-<strong>I</strong>s-<strong>W</strong>hat-<strong>Y</strong>ou-<strong>G</strong>et) editor with real-time feedback, giving you full control over how you would like to your river to appear. </p>

                <h1> <span class="mw-headline">Setup</span></h1>
                <p>To get started, open the Toolbox and create a new project from the Full template then load the Empty Terrain level.  </p>
                <p><br />
                  Use the Terrain Editor tools to create a channel for your new river. This can be as simple or as detailed as you would like it to be. If you are unsure how to use the Terrain Editor, refer to the  <a href="TerrainEditor.html"  title="http://docs.torquepowered.com/torque-3d/official/content/documentation/World%20Editor/Editors/TerrainEditor.html" rel="nofollow">Terrain Editing</a> section.</p>

                <h1> <span class="mw-headline">Interface</span></h1>
                <p>To access the River Editor you can either activate it from the main menu by selecting Editors > River Editor:</p>
                <p><br />
                  <i>menu&gt;Editors&gt;River Editor</i> </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:RiverMenu.jpg" src="images/RiverMenu.jpg" border="0" height="309" width="373" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Alternatively you can click the River icon from the World Editor Tools Selector Bar:</p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:Rivertoolbar.jpg" src="images/Rivertoolbar.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="442" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  The editor has two main parts, one where you can add and manipulate the river nodes (control points) for creation, the other for adjusting the river properties to create the river style (depth, width, flow, ripples etc).  </p>
                <p><br />
                  Whenever the River Editor is active three sections of the screen are updated to contain the editors tool.</p>
                  <p><br />On the right side of the screen are three panes. At the top is the Rivers pane which contains a list of all the rivers currently in the level, if any are present.  In the middle is the River Nodes pane which displays the properties of the currently selected river control point. At the bottom is the Properties Pane which displays the properties of the currently selected river. </p>
                  <p><br /><img src="images/RERiverProperties.png" /></p>
                  <p><br />At the left of the screen the River placement tools will appear and are used to create and modify rivers and their control points. </p>
                  <p><br /><em>Hint: These tool bars are floating and can be moved to any part of your screen.</em></p>
                  <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:RiverIconBar.jpg" src="images/RiverIconBar.jpg" border="0" height="196" width="228" /> </p>
                  <p><br />At the top of the screen in the World Editor Tool Settings Bar, a new set of icons will appear when the River Editor is active. </p>
                  <p><br /><p><img alt="Image:RiverIconBar2.jpg" src="images/RiverIconBar2.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="690" /> </p>
                  <p><br />These icons and their associated values will enable you to quickly set up the width and depth of the river and modify the editor to show and hide some visual aids which can be used to guide your river placement.</p>
                <br /><br /><a name="Adding_a_River" id="Adding_a_River"></a>
                <h1> <span class="mw-headline">Adding a River</span></h1>
                <p>The river is created by placing a series of control points across the terrain which defines the path you would like your river to follow. Each control point, also called a "node", will give you control of how the river will look at any given point .By adjusting each of these points we can have full control of where our river will go, its size, and its orientation. </p>
                
                <p><br />
                  The default width and depth of control points can be set using the Default Width and Default Height properties on the Tool Settings Bar at the top of the editor window. Any new rivers will be created using these settings until you change their values again.</p>
                <p>To create a new river select the Create River icon <img alt="Image:RiverIcon1.jpg" src="images/RiverIcon1.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="32" /> from the tool bar then click on the terrain with the left mouse button where you would like to start your river. Move the mouse away from the clicked location to see the results. Each time you click the terrain you will see three things: (1) a green square which represents the river location that you just placed; (2) a blue square which represents the next location that will be placed the river if you press mouse button again; (3) the surface of the river that will be placed the next time you click the button. Move the mouse to the next point on the terrain that you wish your river to travel to and then click again. Continue moving and clicking until you are finished with the initial placement of your river. </p>
                <p><br />
                  To complete the river placement process press the ESC key. This action will exit the Create River tool leaving your new river selected and ready for adjustments. </p>
                  <p><br />To abort a river creation operation without placing a river at all press the Esc key before selecting a second river point. Once a second river point has been placed the only way to remove the river completely is to delete it, as explained later.</p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:Riverpath.jpg" src="images/Riverpath.jpg" border="0" height="248" width="566" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  The new River will also show up in the Rivers list at the right top of the screen. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:Riverlist.jpg" src="images/Riverlist.jpg" border="0" height="168" width="207" /> </p>
                <p>You will notice that the river itself is color-coded. These visual aids will be of help in adjusting your river. </p>
                <p><br />
                  RED - The red lines at the edges of the river represent the river bounds. These lines need to be moved so that they are hidden by the terrain river bank to avoid gaps between the edge of the water and the surrounding terrain.</p>
                <p><br />
                  GREEN - The green surface represents the depth of the river. This surface needs to be adjusted to be just below the terrain at every point in order for underwater views to be correct. Whenever this surface is above the terrain it will cause an "air bubble" between the bottom of the water and the terrain.  </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:Riverred.jpg" src="images/Riverred.jpg" border="0" height="239" width="581" /> </p>
                <p>The new River may not look correct but with the following set of 
                  tools you will be able to adjust the width, depth
                  and path. </p>
                  <h1><a name="Editing_a_River">Editing a River</a></h1>
                  <p><br />The River Editor provides several tools for modifying rivers after they have been created. If at any time you make a mistake with any tool, you can press CTRL+Z to undo it.</p>
                <a name="Selection_Tool" id="Selection_Tool"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Selection Tool</span></h2>
                <p> Once you have created your initial river you may need to edit some or all of the control points. This tool will allow you to directly select any created point for further editing. To activate the Selection Tool click its icon <img alt="Image:RiverIcon4.jpg" src="images/RiverIcon4.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="32" />  on the Tool Selector bar. Note that the River Editor will automatically select this tool when you have finished creating a new river. </p>
                <p><br />An entire river can be selected by clicking anywhere on a river other than one of its control points. This type of selection will result in the river being highlighted with a "spline", which is a curved line that runs along the center line of the river, and a series of green squares which represent the rivers control points. There are no operations that can be performed on a river as a whole within the River Editor. Selecting a river allows you to see its centerline and it control points for individual selection and manipulation. To perform operations on the entire river such as moving it to a new location use the Object Editors tools as with any other shape in your level.</p>
                <p><br />Control points can be selected individually to adjust each point as necessary. To select a control point left click on one of the colored squares that represent a rivers control points. A selected control point will turn blue. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:RiverSelected.jpg" src="images/RiverSelected.jpg" border="0" height="236" width="372" /> </p>
                  <p><br />Selecting a control point also causes the Properties pane on the right of the screen to be updated to display the current property values of the control point. The Node Properties section will display the position, rotation, width and depth of the selected control point. Values can be directly entered into these fields to modify the point or the Move Tool can be used to manipulate the point using the mouse.</p>
                <p><br /><img alt="Image:RiverNode.jpg" src="images/RiverNode.jpg" border="0" height="90" width="274" /> </p>
                <p>A selected control point will turn blue. </p>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Moving a River</span></h2>
                <p>If at any time you are unhappy with the placement of a selected River control point you can use the Move Point tool to adjust its position. To activate the Move Point tool click its icon <img alt="Image:RiverIcon5.jpg" src="images/RiverIcon5.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="32" /> in the Tool Selector bar. The move gizmo will appear:</p>
                <p><img alt="Image:Rivermove.jpg" src="images/Rivermove.jpg" border="0" height="235" width="373" /> </p>
                <p>The move gizmo is used to move the river point to a new location. Left mouse click on any arrowhead then drag the mouse to move the point along that arrows axis. Release the mouse button to relocate the control point to that new location. Left mouse click on the colored square at the origin of the axes then drag the mouse to freely move the point to without regard to any axis.</p>
                <a name="Scaling_a_River" id="Scaling_a_River"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Scaling a River</span></h2>
                <p>The width and depth of a river can be directly adjusted at a selected control point by using the Scale Point tool. To activate the Scale Point tool click on its icon <img alt="Image:RiverIcon6.jpg" src="images/RiverIcon6.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="32" /> on the Tool Selector. The scaling gizmo will appear:</p>
                <p><img alt="Image:RiverScale.jpg" src="images/RiverScale.jpg" border="0" height="235" width="376" /> </p>
                <p>Left mouse click on the colored cube at the end of any axis then drag the mouse while holding the button down to increase or decrease the size of the road along that axis. To adjust the width and depth at the same time left mouse click on the colored cube at the origin of the axes then drag the mouse while holding down the button. Release the mouse button to change the river to that new width and depth. Changing the width and depth of the river in this manner is the main method to make sure that the red edges and the green surface, mentioned above, are concealed by the terrain. </p>
                <p><br />The Scale point tool will allow you to quickly create very wide river sections, even as wide as a small lake, without having to use a <a href="../Adding%20Objects/WaterBlock.html">WaterBlock</a>. </p>

                <p><img alt="Image:RiverIcon7.jpg" src="images/RiverIcon7.jpg" border="0" height="31" width="32" /> The Rotate Tool can be used to rotate a river at any selected control point. To activate the Rotate Tool click its icon   on the Tool Selector. The rotate gizmo  will appear.  </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:RiverRotate.jpg" src="images/RiverRotate.jpg" border="0" height="233" width="379" /> </p>
                <p>Rotating a river at each control in along the path of a river can make a river appear to be flowing downhill as opposed to a flat surface as is created by default.  </p>
                <p><br />
                  The following image shows what a finished river could look like after editing. </p>
