                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">What is TorqueScript</span></h2>
                <p align="left">TorqueScript (TS) is a proprietary scripting language developed
                  specifically for Torque technology. The language itself is derived from
                  the scripting used for Tribes 2, which was the base tech Torque evolved
                  from. Scripts are written and stored in <b>.cs</b> files, which are compiled and executed by a binary compiled via the C++ engine (.exe for Windows or .app OS X). The CS extension should not be confused with C# files.</p>
                <p><br />
                  The CS extension stands for "C Script," meaning the language 
                  resembles C programming. Though there is a connection, TorqueScript is
                  a much higher level language, which is easier to learn than standard C
                  or C++. </p><br />
                <a name="Basic_Usage" id="Basic_Usage"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Basic Usage</span></h2>
                <p>Like most other scripting languages, such as Python or Java Script,
                  TorqueScript is a high-level programming language interpreted by Torque
                  3D at run time. Unlike C++, you can write your code in script and run
                  it without recompiling your game. </p>
                <p><br />
                  All of your interfaces can be built using the GUI Editor,
                  which saves the data out to TorqueScript. The same goes for data saved
                  by the World Editor or Material Editor. Most of the editors themselves
                  are C++ components exposed and constructed via TorqueScript. </p>
                <p><br />
                  More importantly, nearly all of your game play programming
                  will be written in TorqueScript: inventory systems, win/lose scenarios,
                  AI, weapon functionality, collision response, and game flow. All of these
                  can be written in TorqueScript. The language will allow you to rapidly
                  prototype your game without having to be a programming expert or perform
                  lengthy engine recompiling. </p><br />
                <a name="Scripting_vs_Engine_Programming" id="Scripting_vs_Engine_Programming"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Scripting vs. Engine Programming</span></h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, TorqueScript comprised of the core C++ objects
                  needed to make your game. For example, you will use the PlayerData
                  structure to create player objects for your game. This structure was
                  written in C++: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>C++ PlayerData Code</b> </p>
                <pre>struct PlayerData: public ShapeBaseData {
   typedef ShapeBaseData Parent;
   bool renderFirstPerson;    ///&lt; Render the player shape in first person


   mass = 9.0f;         // from ShapeBase
   drag = 0.3f;         // from ShapeBase
   density = 1.1f;      // from ShapeBase
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  Instead of having to go into C++ and create new PlayerData
                  objects or edit certain fields (such as mass), PlayerData was exposed
                  to TorqueScript: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Example TorqueScript PlayerData Code</b> </p>
                <pre>datablock PlayerData(DefaultPlayerData)
{
   renderFirstPerson = true;

   className = Armor;
   shapeFile = "art/shapes/actors/gideon/base.dts";

   mass = 100;
   drag = 1.3;
   maxdrag = 0.4;

   // Allowable Inventory Items
   maxInv[Pistol] = 1;
   maxInv[PistolAmmo] = 50;
};
</pre>
                <p><br />
                  If you want to change the name of the object, the mass, the
                  inventory, or anything else, just open the script, make the change, and
                  save the file. When you run your game, the changes will immediately
                  take effect. Of course, for this example you could have used the in-game
                  Datablock Editor, but you should get the point. TorqueScript is the
                  first place you should go to write your game play code. </p><br />

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">TorqueScript Editors</span></h2>
                <p>TorqueScript files are essentially text files. This means you have
                  several editors to choose from. Some users prefer to use the stock OS
                  text editors: Notepad on Windows or Text Edit on OS X. Others will use
                  their programming IDEs (Interactive Development Environments), such as
                  Visual Studio for Windows or Xcode on OS X. Third party applications
                  are the most popular choice: </p><br />
